# Quantum-Golf
A game implemented in pygame with golf ball as a quantum function.<br/>
The game is based on a game defined by David Kamensky<br/>

Summary:  See weird quantum effects while playing golf at the subatomic scale. <br/><br/> 

Gameplay and controls:  The golf ball is now a wave (the white squiggly line) and only collapses into one place when you measure it's position (press space bar).  It's likelihood of being measured in different places is related to the wave's amplitude in those places.  You can change these likelihoods by pushing the ball's wave around with your golf club: a potential barrier (grey bar) whose height (up and down arrows) and position (left and right arrows) you can control.  Try to measure the ball inside the hole (green area) with the fewest number of swings (measurements).  When you get the ball into the hole, the hole will be randomly relocated.<br/><br/>
